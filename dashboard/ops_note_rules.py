"""Note classification for the Company Ops dashboard — the single source of truth.

WHY NOTES AT ALL. Two dashboard metrics have no stage behind them, because neither is a
state the deal is IN:

  * "1st Interest Email Sent" — we mailed them something (deck, intro, calendly) while the
    deal legitimately stays wherever it is. There is no v3 stage for it and there should not
    be one: `docs/OPSDATA_PIPELINE.md` §"the outcome IS the stage" forbids a stage that means
    "we tried". So it is read off the note somebody wrote.
  * "One-Pager Received" — them confirming receipt / coming back on the one-pager. `One Pager
    Shared` is us sending; the reply is an event on the deal, not a new state.

ORDER MATTERS — first match wins, same as the sales-side note_rules.py. This module lives NEXT
TO build_ops_dashboard.py and inside the repo on purpose: the sales dashboard once imported its
rules from a local-only sibling directory, which resolved on the laptop and raised ImportError
in Actions, leaving the note KPIs silently empty on every deployed build.

These rules are IMPORTED, never copied. An earlier hand-copy of KPI definitions on the sales
side drifted and inflated dial counts 2.7x.

The regexes below were tuned against the ACTUAL note corpus of portal 246897735 — all 68 bodies
were read, and every one of them lands in a named bucket. Before that pass 39 of 68 fell into
"Other", almost all of them our own size/fit disqualifications ("2-10 employees, not interesting")
that no rule had ever been written for.

Re-run the check after any edit here:

    python dashboard/check_note_rules.py

It classifies every note in the portal and prints whatever still lands in "Other". A handful of
genuinely unclassifiable notes is fine; a cluster is a missing rule.
