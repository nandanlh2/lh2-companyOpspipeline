"""CI-ready: pull the Company Ops Data pipeline from HubSpot -> ops_dashboard_data.json.

Portal `246897735` (the build portal — NOT the main LH2 portal `246754894` that context.md
describes). Pipeline "Company Ops Data".

Each row carries BOTH readings of the pipeline, because the board needs both:

  * `occ` — the metric keys the deal's CURRENT stage satisfies. Summing these across rows
    reproduces the HubSpot board's column counts exactly. This is what the funnels show.
  * `m`   — per metric, the list of [IST day, actor] pairs for every time the deal ENTERED a
    qualifying stage. Distinct rows with an event give "ever reached"; the raw event count
    gives the weekly trend series.

EVERY source counts. An earlier version kept only `sourceType == "CRM_UI"` for activity
metrics, to stop the 10:30 OutFlo sync looking like a record outreach day. Measured cost of
that rule: `Cold LinkedIn Sent` is 5 CRM_UI moves against 17 INTEGRATION, `Email Campaign
Sent` 0 against 7, `Replied` 6 against 28 — so the filter discarded the entire top of the
pipeline and the board read 5 where HubSpot read 879. A move the OutFlo sync made is still a
move that happened.

Two metrics have no stage and come from notes; see ops_note_rules.py for why.

Full spec: docs/OPS_DASHBOARD_METRIC_SPEC.md

Token: HUBSPOT_API_KEY env (CI) or local .env (hubspot_key=...).

Usage:
  python dashboard/build_ops_dashboard.py                  full rebuild -> ops_dashboard_data.json
  python dashboard/build_ops_dashboard.py --deals 1,2      refresh those deals only -> stdout
  python dashboard/build_ops_dashboard.py --deals-since <ISO>   everything modified since then

The executable part lives in main(); everything above it is import-safe, so the daily report
and any later refresh script can import these definitions rather than hand-copying them. TOK is
resolved lazily for the same reason — importing this module must not exit on a missing token.
